# Guess The Number Game :

A simple interactive number guessing game built with JavaScript for Node.js.

## How It Works :

- The game selects a fixed number (90 by default) as the target.

- The user is prompted to guess the number.

- After each guess, the program provides feedback:

- "Too high! Try again" if the guess is above the target

- "Too low! Try again" if the guess is below the target

- The user continues guessing until the correct number is entered.

- The program tracks and displays the number of attempts once the correct guess is made.

## Features :

- Interactive command-line prompts

- Hint messages for each guess

- Counting the number of attempts

- Input validation using Number()
